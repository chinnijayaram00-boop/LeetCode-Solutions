# Count Islands With Total Value Divisible by K

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` and a positive integer `k`. An  **island**  is a group of  **positive**  integers (representing land) that are  **4-directionally**  connected (horizontally or vertically).

The  **total value**  of an island is the sum of the values of all cells in the island.

Return the number of islands with a total value  **divisible by**  `k`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  grid = [[0,2,1,0,0],[0,5,0,0,5],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,4,7,0],[0,2,0,0,8]], k = 5

 **Output:**  2

 **Explanation:** 

The grid contains four islands. The islands highlighted in blue have a total value that is divisible by 5, while the islands highlighted in red do not.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  grid = [[3,0,3,0], [0,3,0,3], [3,0,3,0]], k = 3

 **Output:**  6

 **Explanation:** 

The grid contains six islands, each with a total value that is divisible by 3.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 1000
- 1 <= m * n <= 105
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 106
- 1 <= k <= 106
