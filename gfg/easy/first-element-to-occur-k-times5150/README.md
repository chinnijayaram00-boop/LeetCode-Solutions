# At Least K Occurrences

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  and an integer  **k**, find the first element that occurs at least k times in the array.

- If multiple elements satisfy the condition, return the element whose k-th occurrence appears earliest in the array.
- If no element occurs at least k times, return -1.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Both 7 and 4 occur twice. However, 4 reaches its second occurrence before 7, so the answer is 4.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3, 5, 4], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The element 3 is the only element that occurs at least 3 times in the array.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 2], k = 10
Output: -1
Explanation: No element occurs at least 10 times in the array.
```

class Solution {
    public int firstElementKTime(int[] arr, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int num : arr) {
            int count = map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1;
            map.put(num, count);

            if (count == k) {
                return num;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```
