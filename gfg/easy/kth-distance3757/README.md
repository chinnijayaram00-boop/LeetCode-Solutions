# Any Duplicate Within K Distance

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array of integers,  **arr[]**  and an integer  **k**, check whether there exist two distinct indices i and j such that arr[i] is equal to arr[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 4, 5, 1], k = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The element 5 occurs at indices 1 and 3. Their distance is |3 - 1| = 2, which is less than or equal to k.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 2, 3, 4, 10, 5], k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: The element 10 occurs at indices 0 and 4. Their distance is |4 - 0| = 4, which is greater than k. Hence, no duplicate exists within the given distance.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 1, 3, 2, 4], k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: All elements are distinct, so no duplicate exists.
```

import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean checkWithinK(int[] arr, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

            if (map.containsKey(arr[i])) {
                if (i - map.get(arr[i]) <= k) {
                    return true;
                }
            }

            map.put(arr[i], i);
        }

        return false;
    }
}


```
