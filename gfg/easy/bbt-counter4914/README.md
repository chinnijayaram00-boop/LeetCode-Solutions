# Balanced Binary Tree Counter

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a height  **h**, find the maximum number of distinct balanced binary trees of height exactly h.

A binary tree is balanced if, for every node, the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most 1. A tree with a single node has height 1. An empty tree has height 0.

 **Note:**  Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: h = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Only one tree of height 1 exists i.e. a single node.
```

```
Input: h = 2
Output: 3 
Explanation: 3 distinct balanced trees of height 2 exist.

```

```
Input: h = 3
Output: 15
Explanation: 15 distinct balanced trees of height 3 exist.

```

```java
class Solution {
    public int countBT(int h) {
        long mod = 1000000007L;
        if (h <= 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        long a = 1, b = 1, c = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= h; i++) {
            c = (b * ((2 * a + b) % mod)) % mod;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
        return (int) b;
    }
}

```
